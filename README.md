## Project Overview: 

Lyrical Genius is a Web application that is fun, friendly and simplistic. The way the application highlights this is by first, having the user search 
for a song of their liking, and then second, having them enter the phone number to whom the song will go to. From there, the lyrics to that song will be 
sent, lyric by lyric, to the recipient of their choosing. Although this could be merely looked at as a friendly prank, there is more to it. Lyrical Genius
is a way to let your friends and family know that you are thinking about them, and the songs that you choose can reflect that. By providing the flexability 
to the user to search for songs and send messages to their friends and family without even having them pick up their phone is a feature that greatly simplifies
their experience. Another feature we will like to implement adds some more fun into the mix for the user themself. We will have a mini game hosted on the site 
that lets the users guess the name of a song given a sequence of lyrics to that song. To conclude, we also want the user interface of our
application to look inviting and friendly, to do this we will use different styling techniques the get the look we desire across.
