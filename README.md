## Project Overview: 

Lyrical Genius is a Web application that is fun, friendly and simplistic. The way the application highlights this is by first, having the user search 
for a song of their liking, and then second, having them enter the phone number to whom the song will go to. From there, the lyrics to that song will be 
sent, lyric by lyric, to the recipient of their choosing. Although this could be merely looked at as a friendly prank, there is more to it. Lyrical Genius
is a way to let your friends and family know that you are thinking about them, and the songs that you choose can reflect that. By providing the flexability 
to the user to search for songs and send messages to their friends and family without even having them pick up their phone is a feature that greatly simplifies
their experience. Another feature we will like to implement adds some more fun into the mix for the user themself. We will have a mini game hosted on the site 
that lets the users guess the name of a song given a sequence of lyrics. To conclude, we also want the user interface of our application to look inviting
and friendly, to do this we will use different styling techniques to get the look we desire across.

## Vision Statement:

## Personas:
- Lisa, age 24, is a musician who recently got married in Nashville, Tennessee, a place known for its music. Lisa is a music enthuasiast and after getting her music degree from Vanderbilt University she began song writing. In school, she learned to focus more on what the lyrics of a song are saying rather than the overall melody of the song. Because 
of this, she loves to write love music where the lyrics have deep meaning. Lisa has been a song writer for about three years now and recently started putting her love music on different platforms, notable Spotify, Genius and Apple Music. To surprise and show her husband, Johnny, who has yet to find out Lisa started releasing her music, that she loves him, she wrote him a song. Lisa, not being technically advanced, sought out to find an application that would send the lyrics of her songs to her husband, one by one, because she wants him to show him the affection the words of her song give off. Knowing this, Lyrical Genius would be great for her. Since she is not technically advanced, our UI provides a simplistic interface where all she has to do is search her song and send the Lyrics right to her lover, Johnny.
- Rudy, age 14, is an 8th grader who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. He has always been technologically-savvy, as he has grown up in the generation of smartphones. He doesn’t play any instruments but actively listens to music throughout his day. His middle school Mormon Intermediate school is having their first dance next month and people are already starting to ask each other to the dance. Rudy wants to ask his friend Maddy to the dance but wants to ask in a more personalized way than the generic text. In order to do this, he thought the words of their favorite song “Sugar Sugar” would be the best way to get his message across. By utilizing LyricalGenius’s simple UI, Rudy was able to enter his name, the name of the song, as well as the number he wants to send the lyrics to. Maddy loved the gesture and decided to go with Rudy due to his creativity.
